# Robust-Deepfake-Detection

This repository is the code implementation of the dissertation 'Investigating HSIC Regularisation for Enhanced
Robustness in Localised Artifact-based Deepfake
Detection Models'

This work extends the LAA-Net model by Nguyen et al. found here: https://github.com/10Ring/LAA-Net

No pretrained weights are provided due to file size limits on commits, all necessary pretrained weights for training new models can be found in the original LAA-Net source code above.

The paths in the config file are set to the paths used in Google Colab, adjust paths as needed to run on local machines.

Documentation for running code is found in original LAA-Net source code.
